# Data Anonymization Projects

Welcome to my Data Anonymization Projects repository!

This repository showcases my hands-on experience and expertise in statistical disclosure control and data anonymization techniques. These projects are based on practical use-cases from the renowned textbook:

**"Statistical Disclosure Control for Microdata: Methods and Applications in R" by Matthias Templ (Springer, 2017)**.

## 🚀 About the Projects

The projects are built around detailed practical scenarios to illustrate real-world applications of data anonymization. Each project includes comprehensive R Markdown files demonstrating step-by-step anonymization methods using R and dedicated PDF summaries to provide clear insights into data protection strategies.

### 📌 Use Case 1: Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) 2006
- **Objective:** Protect respondent confidentiality in socio-economic survey data.
- **Methods Applied:** k-anonymity, local suppression, microaggregation, adding correlated noise.
- **Tools Used:** `sdcMicro`, `laeken` packages in R.

### 📌 Use Case 2: Synthetic SES Dataset
- **Objective:** Balance privacy protection with data utility in synthetic earnings data.
- **Methods Applied:** Risk assessment, local suppression, microaggregation, noise addition, utility measurement (Gini coefficient, Confidence intervals, Gender pay gap analysis).
- **Tools Used:** `sdcMicro`, statistical analyses and visualization in R.

## 📚 Summaries of Regulatory Frameworks

Understanding the legal context is crucial for data anonymization. Therefore, I also summarized key regulatory documents that govern data privacy:

- ✅ **Summary of the European Health Data Space Regulation**  
  [📄 **Document (PDF)**](Summary%20of%20the%20European%20Health%20Data%20Space%20Regulation.pdf)

- ✅ **Summary of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
  [📄 **Document (PDF)**](Summary%20of%20the%20General%20Data%20Protection%20Regulation.pdf)

These summaries include clear diagrams, tables, and illustrative flowcharts.
